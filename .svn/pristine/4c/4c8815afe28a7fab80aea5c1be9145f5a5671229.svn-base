This folder contains:

moller_sim.cc:    Main Routine for Simulation.

GNUmakefile:      Makefile. Compiles program into G4WORKDIR/.

CMakeLists.txt    cmake contruct for Makefile (see later note for how to use it)

vis.mac:          Can be called from the simulation prompt in order to
		  run visualization. WARNING: Analysis and visualization
		  cannot run concurrently.

moller_###.root:  ROOT Output file created at end of simulation. The ###
		  refers to the date and time the simulation took place. 
		  The default save location is ~/scratch/ROOTfiles/


bin/, src/, tmp/:	This is where the Makefile compiles and installs the
			program.

include/:               Header files for Simulation Classes.

src/:			Source files for Simulation Classes.

null/:			Trash folder. Things that didn't quite work out.

plots/:			Plots of results made by ROOT.

output/:	        Root output.


HOW TO COMPILE WITH CMAKE (geant4.9.5p01)

cmake version >=2.6 needed (ifarm does not have it)

source env_jlabcue495p01 (this will set up the correct env variables for building)
Create a building directory (for example mkdir build)
Go to the building directory (for example cd build)
Create the makefile with cmake, where you point cmake to the directory where is CMakeLists.txt (for example cmake ../ )
(Because ifarm does have an old version of cmake, I installed a newer version in the work disk, so use:
 /work/halla/parity/disk2/zana/Cmake/cmake-2.8.8/bin/cmake ../ from the build directory)
Now you have the new Makefile created in the build directory: Type make and "prexsim", the new binary file will be created in
$PREXDIR/bin/Linux-g++/  


HOW TO COMPILE FOR geant4.9.4p02

source env_jlabcue494p02 (this will set up the correct env variables for building)
in the $PREXDIR directory type make:
the mollersim binary will be created in $PREXDIR/bin/Linux-g++/





To run the program type, for example, 'bin/Linux-g++/moller_sim runsim_ee.csh' from the G4WORKDIR.

The data structure of the NTuple is as follows:


ion:x:y:z:x0:y0:z0:kineE:px:py:pz:kineE0:px0:py0:pz0:kineE1:px1:py1:pz1:kineE2:px2:py2:pz2:type:volume:theta0:theta1:theta2:ev_num:process:event:creator:hit:kineE_org:theta_org:track:diffXS:totXS:rate



NOTE: 
Moller interactions are defined as a beam particle (Moller0) 
coming from the beam and splitting into Moller1 
(with energy > 5.5GeV) and Moller2 (with energy < 5.5GeV)

During an event, very time that a particle hits a Sensitive 
Detector, it creates a Hit with the following data:


ion	-if using Geant, ion is 1 if the particle was created 
	 by the process of "eIoni", which is how Geant defines 
	 Moller Scattering. Using this as a cut will give you only the 
	 Moller2 particles, as defined above.

x	-x-position where the particle hit the Sensitive Detector
y	-y-position where the particle hit the Sensitive Detector
z	-z-position where the particle hit the Sensitive Detector
x0	-x-position where the Moller interaction occurred
y0	-y-position where the Moller interaction occurred
z0	-z-position where the Moller interaction occurred

kineE	-Energy of the particle when it hit the Sensitive Detector
px	-Unit vector of momentum in x-direction at the Sensitive Detector
py	-Unit vector of momentum in y-direction at the Sensitive Detector
pz	-Unit vector of momentum in z-direction at the Sensitive Detector

kineE0	-Kinetic Energy of the original electron which interacted 
	 inside the target and created particle Moller1 and Moller2 at the
	 interaction point (x0,y0,z0) 

px0	-Unit vector of momentum in x-direction of Moller0 right before 
	 interacting
py0	-Unit vector of momentum in y-direction of Moller0 right before 
	 interacting
pz0	-Unit vector of momentum in z-direction of Moller0 right before 
 	 interacting

kineE1	-Kinetic Energy of the original electron which interacted inside 
	 the target and created particle Moller1 and Moller2 at the
	 interaction point (x1,y1,z1) 

px1	-Unit vector of momentum in x-direction of Moller1 right after 
	 interacting
py1	-Unit vector of momentum in y-direction of Moller1 right after 
	 interacting
pz1	-Unit vector of momentum in z-direction of Moller1 right after 
	 interacting

kineE2	-Kinetic Energy of the original electron which interacted inside
	 the target and created particle Moller1 and Moller2 at the
	 interaction point (x2,y2,z2)
 
px2	-Unit vector of momentum in x-direction of Moller2 right after 
	 interacting.
py2	-Unit vector of momentum in y-direction of Moller2 right after 
	 interacting.
pz2	-Unit vector of momentum in z-direction of Moller2 right after 
	 interacting.

type	-Particle type( electron=0, positron=1, proton=2, antiproton=3, 
	 gamma=4, other=5 )

volume	-Volume number of the Sensitive Detector that recorded this Hit.

theta0	-Angle with respect to the beam axis of Moller0 right before 
	 interacting.
theta1	-Angle with respect to the beam axis of Moller1 right after interacting.
theta2	-Angle with respect to the beam axis of Moller2 right after interacting.

ev_num	-Event number, as assigned by Geant. An event is defined as the 
	 set of particles and interactions that happen after the Particle 
	 Genarator 'throws' a particle into the spectrometer.

process	-Not properly defined at the moment
event	-Not properly defined at the moment.

creator	-Process that created this particle, as assigned by G4
 	 eIoni->         0     
	 conv->          1
	 Decay->         2
	 annihil->       3
	 Brem->          4
	 phot->          5
 	 compt->         6
   	 Transportation->7
    	 msc->           8
     	 All Others->    9

hit	-Same as trackID (see below).

kineE_org - Vertex energy of THIS particle. 
theta_org - Scattering Angle of THIS particle.

track	-Track number as assigned by GEANT. Each particle created in 
	 an Event is given an incremental trackID number. In this case,
	 Moller1 has track=1 and Moller2 has track=2.

diffXS	-Differential cross-section calculated in generator.
totXS	-Total cross-section calculated in generator.

rate    -Rate calculated in generator.
